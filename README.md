# Fleet-Monitoring-System\

The transportation industry is incurring a lot of losses because of drivers taking unwanted breaks, taking longer routes, excessive fuel consumption. A big part of their monetary funds is lost to accidents caused due to negligence.

For vehicle fleets, much of the commercial mass-produced fleet telematics systems most likely provide simple tracking and tracing functions. However, the major improvement that these systems require is the manual detection of the inconsistencies between the real data of the system and the expected data in the logistics system by the supervisors/dispatchers. Moreover, the actual data between the telematics system and the logistics system has to be manually transferred. It is very important the discrepancies that seem to appear during manual detection be nullified to improve the quality of the organization. As much as the efficiency and productivity of the company are of utmost priority, the entire concept of safety, security, and unforeseen ambiguities must also be kept under the radar. An upgrade in the existing system which provides the complete reviewed data of driver’s output including storing correct arrival and departure times at the customer location and updating the logistics system database is almost a very essential need.  Since unexpected events and ambiguities are identified automatically, the messages can be spared of needing to be interpreted by the vehicles manually and can respond to potential disruptions in the transport processes quickly. We present a Fleet Monitoring System in this project which aims to enhance the vehicle tracking API.
The competition within the transportation industry based on promptness, coherence, and quality has increased. The quality of operation of commercial vehicles can be improved using the concept of telematics which also helps in overcoming problems. The systems present on-board inside the vehicles may be capable of communicating with a stationary machine inside the dispatching office. These systems help greatly in closing the distance between the knowledge of the drivers and that of the dispatchers at the office. In the areas of information sharing between dispatchers and drivers, monitoring & tracking of fleet management, and preparation of handling operations, the main potential of fleet telematics systems emerges. Fleet telematics solutions vendors pledge that their solutions will be used to take advantage of the different possibilities. However, to get a grip on the full potential of fleet telematics systems, it is important to compare the actual data available in the fleet telematics system with the expected data in the logistics system.


Features of fleet monitoring include - 

Fuel Indication - The amount of fuel filled at each station and the real-time fuel consumed is displayed on the dashboard.

Temperature Indication - Perishable items, Medicines, etc have to be maintained at a constant temperature to avoid it from getting ruined. Thus, Monitoring the temperature at all times becomes essential.

GPS Tracking - Knowing the real-time location of the truck, the route the truck is taking to reach the destination becomes important and our dashboard displays the real-time location with the current speed. It also provides a geo-fencing option to raise alerts when the driver crosses a boundary.

Driver Drowsiness Alerts - Due to excessive work pressure and inadequate rest the chances of the driver drowsing in the truck is high. Our drowsiness detector monitors the drowsy levels of the drivers in real-time and triggers an alarm if the driver is falling drowsy and also sends a high priority alert to the supervisor.

Dashboard - All the parameters like weight, temperature, fuel, location, speed of the truck is displayed on the dashboard giving the user a bird's eye view of the entire truck. All the parameters can be modified according to that particular trip to suit the delivery needs.

Alerts Notifier - All the alerts are prioritized by the user. High priority alerts like drowsy driver trigger instant call alert to the supervisor for immediate action to be taken. 

SOS Button - This is present on the driver’s app triggers an alert to the supervisor with the current location of the truck.
